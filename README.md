# Chessi
# Chess Analyzer

Chessi is a WPF application written in C#. It was developed as a learning project by me (beginner programmer with an interest in both chess and coding). 
The application analyzes Portable Game Notation (PGN) files to provide insights about chess games, such as which piece performs the checkmate most often.
Would love to have anyone contribute to making Chessi more comprehensive and fulfill ## Future Plans
## Features

- Load a PGN file and display its contents
- Analyze all games in the file and determine which piece performed the checkmate
- Display the analysis result with a breakdown of each piece's checkmate count

## Future Plans

- Implement a PGN parser for more sophisticated analysis
- Online synchronization to fetch PGN data directly from popular chess websites
- Integrate with a chess engine for move analysis and evaluation

## Requirements

- .NET Framework 4.7.2 or higher
- A Windows operating system

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the solution file (`ChessAnalyzer.sln`) in Visual Studio.
3. Build and run the application.
4. Click "Upload PGN File" and select a PGN file.
5. Click "Analyze Checkmate Moves" to perform the analysis.
6. The analysis result is displayed in the bottom text box.
